# Django_CustomerManagement
A customer management web app built using the Django framework. It is my first project in Django :)

How to run this project on your machine.

1. Download / clone the code into your machine. 
2. Move into Django_CustomerManagement directory
3. Optional : Start a virtualenv
4. Install the following dependencies : (using pip3 )
    - django
    - django- filter
5. Run the server using "python3 manage.py runserver". It should run on your local port :8000. 

Thanks for viewing my project!! 

Abhishek :)
